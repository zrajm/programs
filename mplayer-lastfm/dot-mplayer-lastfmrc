# This is just an example config file. It should be named either
# "~/.mplayer-lastfmrc" or "~/.mplayer/mplayer-lastfm.conf" (if both files
# exists, only the previous one will be read). The below five values are the
# only ones you can change.
#
# Strings may be quoted with single or double quotes. Comments are allowed on
# separate lines, or at end of lines. There's no tilde expansion, and since the
# programs pwd at runtime is the directory it was started from, file names
# should be specified with full path.
#
# NB: There are no default values, so you really must set the status and cache
# file option, or you'll most likely end up with an install of mplayer-lastfm
# that doen't work.
