First create a directory for your git repository:

    mkdir repo-name.git
    cd repo-name.git

Now initialize the repo ("--bare" causes repo to be initiated directly in the
current directory, instead of in a ".git" subdir -- which is what you do on
your own machine).

    git --bare init --shared=group    # ("init-db" on older git versions)
    chgrp -R tech *

To use git over HTTP you also need (on earlier versions of git replace "mv"
command below with "chmod a+x hooks/post-update" -- "mv" works from at least
version 1.6.3.3):

    git --bare update-server-info
    mv hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update
