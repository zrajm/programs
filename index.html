<h2>Zrajm’s Programs and Hacks</h2>

<p>These are some of my older small programs. As time has passed, I have mostly
moved my source code to <a href="https://github.com/zrajm/">Github</a> and I
expect I’ll eventually get around to moving the below repos there in a more
proper, less halfassed, fashion. I used to be a <i><a
href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a></i> user, so some of the below programs
have <i>portage ebuilds</i>. Feedback of any kind would be most appreciated
(write to <i><a
href="mailto:zrajm@klingonska.org">zrajm@klingonska.org</a></i>).

  <tr>
    <td><a href="binratd/">binratd</a>
    <td><i>binratd</i> is a small daemon, which allows the user to quickly and
    exactly move the mouse pointer using the keyboard (or commands). It works
    by splitting the screen into four equally-sized quadrants placing the
    pointer in the middle. User chooses one of the quadrants, which moves the
    mouse pointer there, and splits that into four subquadrants. The process is
    repeated until mouse pointer is located where user wants it (typically 2-6
    keypresses required to hit the exact right spot, depending on spot size and
    placement; 12 keypresses gives you 1 pixel precision on a 1024x768
    screen). <b>Requires <i><a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></i> and
    CPAN module <i><a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~ctrondlp/X11-GUITest-0.21/GUITest.pm">X11::GUITest</a></i>
    to work.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="Log-Parse/">Log::Parse</a>
    <td><i>Log::Parse</i> is a Perl module for parsing logfiles. It can handle
    multiple-line log entries, can resume reading where a previous instance
    left off (esp. useful on files which continuously grow) and has a callback
    function for transparent extraction of date/time (or other data) from the
    header of each log entry. Reading of files is done in chunks for better
    performance.
    <br>     A regex is used to match the beginning of the log entries, and all
    parenthesized subexpressions in the regex are passed on to the callback
    function, which in turn may do any processing wanted. Callback result is
    returned with each <tt>read()</tt> (in list context) together with the read
    log entry, making your log-parsing loop exceedingly simple, no matter how
    complex your log format may be. <b>Requires <i><a
    href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></i> to work.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="irssi-scripts/">irssi-scripts</a>
    <td>These are a few plugin scripts
    for <i><a href="http://irssi.org">Irssi</a></i> that have written and
    use: <i>debuggy.pl</i>—don’t remember what this
    does; <i>fifo_remote.pl</i>—a “remote control” which lets you send Irssi
    commands through a named pipe; <i>ratified.pl</i>—for <i><a
    href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">Ratpoison</a></i> users, displays
    specified incoming messages in the ratpoison status
    bar; <i>xcuses.pl</i>—define any number of aliases for changing away
    status, each with its own message, e.g. <tt>/zz</tt> for “away sleeping”
    and <tt>/work</tt> for an “away at work”; <i>zz</i>—shell command to change
    call the <tt>/zz</tt> command in Irssi, symlink to <i>zz</i> to call any
    other command. <b>All scripts requires <i><a
    href="http://irssi.org">Irssi</a></i> to work; <i>zz</i> additionally
    requires the <i>fifo_remote.pl</i> and <i>xcuses.pl</i> scripts here
    included.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="mplayer-lastfm/">mplayer-lastfm</a>
    <td><i>Mplayer-lastfm</i> is a wrapper script; it starts <i>mplayer</i>
    (and passes along command line arguments) and then stays around and
    parses <i>mplayer</i>’s terminal output, to find out which files are being
    played. Played files are examined for audio tags, and, if found, these are
    scrobbled to <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> (account info is stored
    in a small config file). <b>Requires <i><a
    href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></i>, <i><a
    href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a></i> and <i><a
    href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/taginfo">taginfo</a></i> to work.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="ogglink/">ogglink</a>
    <td><i>Ogglink</i> is a command line tool. It creates
    links to directories containing music—assuming that each directory
    contains only one album—and names the resulting link according to any
    tags found in the music files. That is, as long as your music files are
    decently tagged, and organised one album per directory, the links will be
    systematically named, <i>regardless of the naming scheme of the music
    files.</i>
    <br>     I use this to create a homogenous list of music for my jukebox
    system, while still retaining the original file names—useful, for
    example, to be able to continue seeding a music torrent. <b>Requires <i><a
    href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></i> and <i><a
    href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/taginfo">taginfo</a></i> to
    work.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="outwrap/">outwrap</a>
    <td><i>Outwrap</i> is a simple output wrapper for cronjobs. It can redirect
    the output of (any) specified command to one or more email addresses, and
    it can be used to suppress output on successful execution (emailing the
    complete output of the cronjob only if it fails with exit status other than
    zero). It also always includes the exit code of the cronjob it its
    output. <b>Requires a POSIX-compatible “/bin/sh” (e.g. <i><a
    href="http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/">dash</a></i>, but <a
    href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh/">please don’t use bash as
    “/bin/sh”</a>), and a an MTA which provides the “sendmail” binary
    (e.g. <i><a href="http://www.postfix.org/">postfix</a></i>
    or <i><a href="http://www.exim.org/">exim</a></i>).</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="phoned/">phoned</a>
    <td><i>Phoned</i> is a small daemon for logging time and caller ID
    information of incoming phone calls. It requires a modem with caller ID
    detection.—Logging is done using the system logger.
    <br>     The program is written in Perl, and is primarily written to
    fullfill my own needs. That means you’ll probably have to re-write
    something to get it to work for you, unless you (like me) live in Sweden,
    and use ratpoison. Also included is a script for use with <i>metalog</i>,
    which beeps and displays the calling number on screen when a call is
    received. (Changes and ideas are welcome, also, maybe someday I’ll re-write
    this program C.)
  <tr>
    <td><a href="ratmen/">ratmen</a>
    <td><i>Ratmen</i> is a simple program for displaying a menu in a window. On
    selection is may either run a program or simply write something on standard
    out. It is inspired by, and is similar in function to, <i>9menu</i>
    and <i>ratmenu</i> but is muchly improved. It includes: User settings in
    X resources, long and short option names (using getopts), scrollable menus
    (if they do not fit on screen), <i>both</i> mouse <i>and</i> keyboard
    support, exiting on unfocus, and a decent manpage.
  <tr>
    <td><a href="termmen/">termmen</a>
    <td><i>Termmen</i> is written in <i><a
    href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a></i>, and aims to do what <i>Ratmen</i>
    does, except entirely inside the terminal. The menu can’t be navigated
    using the mouse, but instead has several <i><a
    href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/">less</a></i>-inspired
    keybindings for navigation. The menu is displayed on standard error, using
    ANSI terminal escape codes, and user selections are outputted on stardard
    out for a calling script to read. Easily invoked in scripts, e.g.
    using <tt>REPLY="$(termmen Yes y No n)"</tt> (REPLY is then set to y/n
    depending on whether user chose "Yes" or "No" on menu.)
    <b>Requires <i><a href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a></i> to work.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="Term-ProgressMeter/">Term::ProgressMeter</a>
    <td>A Perl module for outputting a progress meter on the terminal. It’s
    invoked at user-specified intervall, and you pass it references to a couple
    of variables which it is then free to inspect. The progress meter is then
    automatically updated at the given interval, with no additional trouble for
    the programmer. Kinda neat. Beta. It is quite similar to the <i><a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Term-ProgressBar/lib/Term/ProgressBar.pm"
    >Term::ProgressBar</a></i> (by Martyn J. Pearce, available
    from <i><a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a></i>), except that I
    wanted to be able to mix the progress bar with normal output freely (this
    is almost totally transparent
    with <i>Term::ProgressMeter</i>. <b>Requires <i><a
    href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></i> to work.</b>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="zimplex/">Zimplex</a>
    <td><i>Zimplex</i> my attempt at making Opera’s UI bearable. A very
    non-fancy skin, made with only simplicity of design, clarity of use, and
    minimal screen usage in mind. It’s based on <i><a
    href="http://my.opera.com/community/customize/skins/info/?id=5306"
    >Simple</a></i>, with tab colours from <i><a
    href="http://my.opera.com/community/customize/skins/info/?id=3899"
    >Cimple</a></i>. As soon as I get around to doing it, I’ll redo the reload
    button to be more of a classic one—maybe more like the one
    in <i><a href="http://my.opera.com/community/customize/skins/info/?id=5730"
    >Dimple</a></i>—the current one is an unintuitive yin-yangy-thingy.
    The skin is sorta half-finished, but usable (not all icons have been
    “unrounded”—some still retain the look from <i>Simple</i>—I’ll get back to
    that). <b>Requires <i><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a></i> to
    work.</b>
